  <h3 class="text-center">Here's about Oppenheimer</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>J. Robert Oppenheimer was born in New York City on April 22,1904 to Ella (n√©e Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a wealthy textile importer. </li>
     <li>He worked closely with Nobel Prize-winning experimental physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data their machines were producing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</li>
     <li>Oppenheimer did important research in theoretical astronomy (especially as related to general relativity and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field theory, including its extension into quantum electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, which include the neutron, meson and neutron star.</li>
     <li>On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a crash program to develop an atomic bomb</li>
     <li>He was given the title "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb.</li>
     <li>For his services as director of Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was awarded the Medal for Merit from President Harry S. Truman in 1946.</li>
     <li>He felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.</li>
     <li> In 1966.He fell into a coma on February 15, 1967, and died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, on February 18, aged 62.</li>
